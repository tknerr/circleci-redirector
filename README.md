# CircleCI Redirector

Provides deterministic / bookmarkable URLs which the [CircleCI REST API](https://circleci.com/docs/api) currently does not offer:

 * link to latest build on a specific branch
 * deterministic URLs for build artifacts

The URLs below respond with a HTTP 302 redirect to a specific build on circleci, so whenever you use this API ensure that your HTTP client follows redirects.

# URL Patterns

Get redirected to the latest build details:

 * `GET /api/v1/<user>/<repo>/tree/<branch>/latest`

Get redirected to the list of build artifacts for the latest build:

 * `GET /api/v1/<user>/<repo>/tree/<branch>/latest/artifacts`

Get redirected to the download link of a specific build artifact:

 * `GET /api/v1/<user>/<repo>/tree/<branch>/latest/artifacts/<artifact>`

# Development

Install the gem dependencies:

    $ bundle install

Bring up the sinatra webapp in development mode (with automatic reloading):

    $ rackup

Access the webapp in your browser, hack and reload:

 * http://localhost:9292/
